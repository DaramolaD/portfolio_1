# Daramola Daniel's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio page! This page showcases my skills and experience as a frontend developer and designer. I'm passionate about creating beautiful and user-friendly websites and applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, and Webflow.
Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

    Project 1: A responsive website for a small business that specializes in selling handmade jewelry. 
    I worked closely with the client to develop a modern and user-friendly design that showcases their products.

    Project 2: An e-commerce website built using ReactJS and Shopify. 
    I designed and developed the website from scratch, including the layout, product pages, and shopping cart functionality.

    Project 3: A landing page for a tech startup. I used Webflow to design and develop a 
    responsive landing page that effectively communicates the company's value proposition and encourages user engagement.
